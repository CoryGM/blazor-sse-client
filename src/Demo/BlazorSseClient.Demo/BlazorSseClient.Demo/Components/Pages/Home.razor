<h2>Blazor Server Sent Events Demo</h2>

<p>
    This application shows several implementations of the 
    BlazorSseClient library.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>BlazorSseClient</strong> library is a simple and efficient 
    way to handle Server-Sent Events (SSE) in Blazor applications. It 
    provides a straightforward API for connecting to SSE endpoints, 
    receiving events, and managing the connection lifecycle.
</p>

<p>
    The demo application includes examples of using the library in both
    server and WebAssembly Blazor projects. The <a href="/scores">Sports Scores</a>
    page demonstrates the same component implemented in both hosting models.
