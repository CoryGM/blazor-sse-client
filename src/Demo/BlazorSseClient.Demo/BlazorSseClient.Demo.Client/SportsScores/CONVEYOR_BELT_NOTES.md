# Conveyor Belt Marquee - Implementation Notes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Hard Cap on Items Removed**
- **Previous**: System had a `MaxActiveItems = 3` limit
- **Fixed**: Removed artificial limit - system now displays as many items as can fit within the timing constraints
- **Benefit**: True conveyor belt behavior that scales with available width

### 2. **Item Replacement Bug Fixed**
- **Previous**: When an item finished its journey, the last visible item would change content instead of a new item being added
- **Fixed**: Each item maintains its identity throughout its entire journey using `ConveyorBeltItem` objects
- **Benefit**: Items never change content during their animation - new items are truly new DOM elements

## Key Improvements

### Architecture Changes
- **Queue Management**: Separated incoming scores from active belt items
- **Item Identity**: Each item has a unique `ItemId` that persists throughout its lifecycle
- **Timing Precision**: Reduced timer interval to 50ms for smoother updates
- **Lifecycle Management**: Items are properly removed only after completing their full journey

### Configuration
```csharp
private const int ItemSpacingMs = 2000;  // 2 seconds between items
private const int ItemDurationMs = 12000; // 12 seconds total journey
```

### How It Works Now
1. **Score Arrival**: New scores queue in `_incomingScores`
2. **Belt Addition**: Items move from queue to `_conveyorBeltItems` with proper spacing
3. **Animation**: Each item gets unique DOM element with `data-item-id` attribute
4. **Cleanup**: Items removed only after completing 12-second journey
5. **No Limits**: System can handle unlimited items based on timing constraints

### Visual Result
- Items flow smoothly from right to left
- Each item maintains consistent content throughout its journey
- New items appear as separate elements, never replacing existing ones
- Natural spacing prevents overcrowding while maximizing throughput
- Scales automatically with screen width and score frequency

This creates a professional, TV-style sports ticker experience where multiple scores can be visible simultaneously without artificial limits.
